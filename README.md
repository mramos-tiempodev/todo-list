TODO LIST
=========

#This is just other php sample code with complete MVC pattern 

The idea is to create a todo list with a rest API, is not complete but I'm using several design patterns as well SOLID
principles, the same way I'm using ajax, jQuery, bootstrap, font awesome, design patterns for javascritp (module pattern)
other things that I used was vagrant, mysql, nginx, phpunit
